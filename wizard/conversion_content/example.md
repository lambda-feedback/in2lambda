This paper contains FIVE questions. Attempt every question.
The numbers shown by each question are for your guidance; they indicate approximately how the examiners intend to distribute the marks for this paper. A Data and Formulæ Book is provided.

This is an OPEN BOOK Examination

This time-limited remote assessment has been designed to be open book. You may use resources which have been identified by the examiner to complete the assessment and are included in the instructions for the examination. You must not use any additional resources when completing this assessment.

The use of the work of another student, past or present, constitutes plagiarism. Giving your work to another student to use constitutes an offence. Collusion is a form of plagiarism and will be treated in a similar manner. This is an individual assessment and thus should be completed solely by you. The College will investigate all instances where an examination or assessment offence is reported or suspected, using plagiarism software, vivas and other tools, and apply appropriate penalties to students. In all examinations we will analyse exam performance against previous performance and against data from previous years and use an evidence-based approach to maintain a fair and robust examination. As with all exams, the best strategy is to read the question carefully and answer as fully as possible, taking account of the time and number of marks available.

Q1. A mixture of helium ( He ), oxygen ( $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ) and nitrogen ( $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ ) at 298 K is contained in a $100 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ rigid tank. The partial pressures of the component gases are: $P_{\mathrm{He}}=200 \mathrm{kPa}$; $P_{\mathrm{O} 2}=300 \mathrm{kPa}$; and $P_{\mathrm{N} 2}=500 \mathrm{kPa}$. All the component gases may be assumed to behave as perfect gases with the thermodynamic data provided in the data and formulæ book. Calculate the following:
(a) The mass fraction of each component gas.
(b) The specific gas constant, $R$, of the mixture in units of $\mathrm{kJ} /(\mathrm{kg} . \mathrm{K})$.
(c) The specific heats $c_{P}$ and $c_{V}$ of the mixture in units of $\mathrm{kJ} /(\mathrm{kg} . \mathrm{K})$.
(d) The maximum useful work that can be obtained from this gas mixture in units of kJ , if the environmental pressure is $P_{0}=1$ bar and the environmental temperature is $T_{0}=298 \mathrm{~K}$.

## Note that Q1 is worth 20 marks in total for all of the sub-questions (Q1a to Q1d). These are distribution as follows:

## Solution to Q1 Part (a) (3 marks in total)

The total pressure is
$P_{1}=P_{\mathrm{He}}+P_{\mathrm{O} 2}+P_{\mathrm{N} 2}=200+300+500=1000 \mathrm{kPa}$
The mole fractions are equal to the pressure fractions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& n f_{H e}=\frac{P_{H e}}{P_{1}}=\frac{200}{1000}=20 \% \\
& n f_{O_{2}}=\frac{P_{O_{2}}}{P_{1}}=\frac{300}{1000}=30 \% \\
& n f_{N_{2}}=\frac{P_{N_{2}}}{P_{1}}=\frac{500}{1000}=50 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

We consider 1 kmol of this mixture, then the mass of each constituent are

$$
\begin{aligned}
& m_{\mathrm{He}}=n_{\mathrm{He}} M_{\mathrm{He}}=0.2 \mathrm{kmol} \times 4 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{kmol}=0.8 \mathrm{~kg} \\
& m_{\mathrm{O} 2}=n_{\mathrm{O} 2} M_{\mathrm{O} 2}=0.3 \mathrm{kmol} \times 32 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{kmol}=9.6 \mathrm{~kg} \\
& m_{\mathrm{N} 2}=n_{\mathrm{N} 2} M_{\mathrm{N} 2}=0.5 \mathrm{kmol} \times 28 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{kmol}=14 \mathrm{~kg}
\end{aligned}
$$

The total mass is

$$
\begin{aligned}
m & =m_{\mathrm{He}}+m_{\mathrm{O} 2}+m_{\mathrm{N} 2} \\
& =0.8+9.6+14 \\
& =24.4 \mathrm{~kg}
\end{aligned}
$$

The mass fractions are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& m f_{H e}=\frac{m_{H e}}{m}=\frac{0.8}{24.4}=3.28 \% \\
& m f_{O_{2}}=\frac{m_{O_{2}}}{m}=\frac{9.6}{24.4}=39.34 \% \\
& m f_{N_{2}}=\frac{m_{N_{2}}}{m}=\frac{14}{24.4}=57.38 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

Solution to Q1 Part (b) (5 marks in total)
From Table E. 3 (on page 50) of the MED data and formula handbook:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& R_{H e}=2.08 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{~K} \\
& R_{O_{2}}=0.26 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{~K} \\
& R_{N_{2}}=0.297 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{~K}
\end{aligned}
$$

The specific gas constant of the mixture is determined from

$$
\begin{aligned}
R & =\sum_{i} m f_{i} \times R_{i} \\
& =0.0328 \times 2.08+0.3934 \times 0.26+0.5738 \times 0.297=0.3409 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{~K}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Solution to Q1 Part (c) (6 marks in total)

From Table E. 3 (on page 50) of the MED data and formula handbook:
$c_{p, \text { Не }}=5.2 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}$
$c_{p, O_{2}}=0.92 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}$
$c_{p, N_{2}}=1.04 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}$
$c_{\mathrm{v}, \text { Не }}=3.12 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}$
$c_{\mathrm{v}, O_{2}}=0.66 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}$
$c_{\mathrm{v}, N_{2}}=0.74 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_{p} & =\sum_{i} m f_{i} \times c_{p, i} \\
& =0.0328 \times 5.2+0.3934 \times 0.92+0.5738 \times 1.04 \\
& =1.12924 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{~K}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_{v} & =\sum_{i} m f_{i} \times c_{\mathrm{v}, i} \\
& =0.0328 \times 3.12+0.3934 \times 0.66+0.5738 \times 0.74 \\
& =0.786592 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{~K}
\end{aligned}
$$

or we may find $c_{\mathrm{v}}$ of the mixture as
$c_{\mathrm{v}}=c_{\mathrm{p}}-R=1.12924-0.3409=0.78834 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} \cdot \mathrm{K}$

## Solution to Q1 Part (d) (6 marks in total)

The mass of the mixture in the rigid tank is given by

$$
m_{1}=\frac{P_{1} V}{R T_{1}}=\frac{1000 \times 100}{0.3409 \times 298}=984.366 \mathrm{~kg}
$$

The specific non-flow exergy of the mixture is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
b_{\text {non flow }} & =\left(u_{1}-u_{0}\right)+P_{0}\left(v_{1}-v_{0}\right)-T_{0}\left(s_{1}-s_{0}\right) \\
& =0+P_{0}\left(\frac{R T_{1}}{P_{1}}-\frac{R T_{0}}{P_{0}}\right)-T_{0}\left[c_{P} \ln \left(\frac{T_{1}}{T_{0}}\right)-R \ln \left(\frac{P_{1}}{P_{0}}\right)\right] \\
& =R T_{0}\left(\frac{P_{0}}{P_{1}}-1\right)+R T_{0} \ln \left(\frac{P_{1}}{P_{0}}\right) \\
& =0.3409 \times 298 \times\left(\frac{100}{1000}-1\right)+0.3409 \times 298 \times \ln \left(\frac{1000}{100}\right) \\
& =-91.4294+233.9154 \\
& =142.486 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg}
\end{aligned}
$$

The total non-flow exergy of the mixture is

$$
\begin{aligned}
B_{\text {non flow }} & =m b_{\text {non flow }} \\
& =984.366 \times 142.486 \\
& =140258.374 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

A car is being towed with two ropes as shown in figure~\ref{A1:fig:Q3}. If the resultant of the two forces is a \SI{30}{\N} force parallel to the long axis of the car, find:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the tension in each of the ropes, if $\alpha = \ang{30}$.
	\item the value of $\alpha$ such that the tension in rope, $T_2$ is minimal.
\end{enumerate}

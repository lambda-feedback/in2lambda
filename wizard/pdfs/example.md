## Problem Set 1: Fluid Properties

1. Which of the following statements correctly describes a fluid?
a) A fluid flows under shear force
b) A fluid resists shear force
c) A fluid deforms indefinitely under shear force
d) A fluid is one of the three states of matter
2. Using diagrams write a brief explanation of the difference between a solid and a fluid
3. Draw a graph showing the changes in denisty, $\rho$ of a fluid as the size of the element volume, $V$ increases. Mark the region where the continuum assumption is valid.
4. If the continuum assumption holds for a particular fluid which of the following statements are true?
a) The density of the fluid does not vary as a function of position, but can vary as a function of time
b) The density of the fluid varies as a function of position, and time
c) The density of the fluid does not vary in the element volume $V$
d) The density of the fluid does not vary as a function of time
5. Why is the element volume, $V$ at which the continuum volume is valid larger for blood than water?
6. Figures 1 and 2 are two views of a Formula 1 race. Which view is consistent with a Lagrangian description and which view is consistent with a Eulerian description?
7. Hydrostatics is the study of static fluids. What does it mean if a fluid is static? Give an example of a static fluid
8. Which of the following properties are scalars?
a) Velocity
b) Pressure
c) Temperature
d) Acceleration

12. Write down the formula for Reynolds number, defining any symbols
13. The Reynolds number describes the ratio of inertial to viscous effects. Which of these effects is more important in a laminar flow?
14. Describe some of the features of a turbulent flow
15. Water from a tap with a diameter of 2 cm flows with an average velocity of $2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Calculate the Reynolds number for this flow assuming the dynamic viscosity of water is 0.001 Pa s . Is the flow laminar or turbulent?
16. For a 70 kg human the internal diameter of the inferior vena cava is $0.6-1.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ and the average velocity of the blood flow is $21 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$. Calculate the Reynolds number in
this vein assuming the dynamic viscosity of blood to be 0.003 Pa.s and the density is $1060 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. Is this flow laminar or turbulent?
17. For each of the following flows, perform a very rough estimate of the Reynolds number and describe whether this is high-Reynolds-number or low-Reynolds number flow:
(a) Squeezing toothpaste onto a toothbrush (viscosity of toothpaste is approx 100 Pas ).
(b) Bacteria swimming.
(c) Airflow in the trachea (density of air is $1.2 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ and viscosity of air is $1.8 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~Pa} \mathrm{~s}$ ).
(d) A 5 cm -long fish swimming.
(e) A train.
(f) Glacier flow (effective viscosity of ice is 6 bar years $\approx 2 \times 10^{13}$ Pas and speed of glacier is around $50 \mathrm{~m} /$ year ).
(g) Spreading jam on bread (viscosity of jam is about 8 Pas )
18. a) Calculate the Reynolds number for a steel ballbearing of diameter 2 mm and density $8,000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ falling through glycerol of density $1200 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ and viscosity 1.2 Pa s , in terms of the velocity of the ball, $v$.
b) The Stokes drag formula is applicable for Reynolds numbers of less than 1. What is the fastest velocity, $v$ at which the Stokes Drag formula still applies?

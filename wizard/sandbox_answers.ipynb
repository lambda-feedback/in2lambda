      "\n",
      "### Q1\n",
      "\n",
      "This question was designed to test the understanding and achievement of learning outcomes related to the selection of equations and their solution to solve practical problems (e.g., computation of forces). It also tested physical understanding by asking students to draw a velocity profile under well-defined constraints, select values for physical quantities, and impose boundary conditions. Overall, students performed relatively well. They demonstrated awareness of fluid mechanics equations, their selection, and use in solving a problem. Furthermore, many students showed very good physical insight when choosing numerical values for some parameters and critically commenting on the results. The main barriers to successfully completing the question were mainly related to the selection of boundary conditions and insufficient mathematical skills. More detailed comments for each part of the question are provided below.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(a)** Almost all students selected the correct set of equations. Some mistakes were found in explaining the selection, such as missing assumptions or insufficiently formulated explanations (note: the difference between \"constant\" and \"uniform\" is crucial).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(b)** Most students were able to use the assumptions to explain the required dependence. There were some attempts to solve the part using the continuity equation, which did not lead to the desired conclusion. Occasionally, the steady-state assumption was forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(c)** This part was generally addressed correctly. Some issues arose with the boundary conditions (e.g., imposed at the center of the duct) and, in isolated cases, with the integration process.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(d)** The proper equation (the $z$-component) was selected. However, many issues were found regarding the treatment of the gravitational volume force term (either the wrong direction or incorrect physical dimensions, such as missing density). There were also many issues with boundary conditions (e.g., the wrong direction for the wall velocity, inappropriate boundary condition at the center of the duct, or applying the boundary condition at $-R$). Integration mistakes (such as an incorrect integral of $1/r$) were also common.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(e)** Several issues were noted in performing a surface integral over a circle. This was mainly due to mathematical errors. More practice with integrals in cylindrical polar coordinates is recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(f)** Many students showed some lack of understanding here. The concept of zero net mass flow rate means the axial velocity must exhibit both negative and positive components. Only a relatively limited number of students suggested a reasonable velocity profile (with both positive and negative axial components).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(g)** Overall, students demonstrated a good understanding of the computation of forces and effectively computed the shear forces (starting from the traction vector and the definition of tensors). More clarity is needed in identifying whether the force on the fluid or the force on the wall is being computed. It should also be made clear that tensors and other quantities are computed at a specific interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(h)** The answers to this question were mostly reasonable. The examiners appreciated the discussion regarding selected values and the possible sources of error. However, many answers were affected by results from previous sections that did not have the correct physical dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q2\n",
      "\n",
      "**(a)**  \n",
      "- Few students could list all the assumptions.  \n",
      "- Commonly missed were body forces, uniform flow, pressure gradient, and self-similarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**(b)**  \n",
      "- Most students used the displacement thickness, though any thickness definition was acceptable.  \n",
      "- In general, performance was good; however, a significant minority did not recognize that the wake is twice the width of the boundary layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**(c)**  \n",
      "- Performance was bimodal. Almost all students who stated the principle of mass conservation received full or high marks. Other approaches generally failed.  \n",
      "- This part effectively distinguished between students who knew about displacement thickness but not how to use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**(d)**  \n",
      "- Sketches indicating good intuitive understanding were common and welcomed.  \n",
      "- However, few sketches indicated physically meaningful scales (e.g., the appropriate length scale).\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer to this question is elaborated in the Lecture Notes for L17 on turbulence.  \n",
      "Answers that referred to kinetic energy ($k$) or the magnitude of fluctuations were given partial credit, as those quantities are unknown in this problem. For example, some students estimated $u'_{\\text{RMS}}$ as 5% of $U_0$. Many students regurgitated Kolmogorov scales, which were not directly relevant (credit was given only if discussed meaningfully).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Q2 worked well as an exam question. It allowed all students to demonstrate their understanding while clearly differentiating those who had studied thoroughly and gained deeper insight. The question tested various aspects, including the memorization of assumptions, basic application of those assumptions, extension to a slightly different context, sketching, and the ability to express ideas on an open-ended question (such as the final part discussing the effects of a honeycomb). \n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the biggest criticism of this question is that it was limited in testing engineering problem solving due to time constraints. With an extra 5–10 minutes, additional aspects (such as the drag on the honeycomb, pressure drop, optimum hole size, suppression of turbulence at the inlet, or the uniformity of the outlet flow) might have been explored.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q3\n",
      "\n",
      "**(a)**  \n",
      "- Few students could list all the assumptions.  \n",
      "- Marks were deducted for including grossly incorrect assumptions (e.g. \"incompressible,\" \"viscous,\" \"Newtonian\").  \n",
      "- Note that “compressible” is not an assumption since the flow is not one-dimensional; such incorrect assumptions were usually ignored rather than penalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "**(b)**  \n",
      "- Most students performed very well in this part.  \n",
      "- Only a very small number either misplaced the Mach number (outside the brackets) or confused $T_0$ with $T_e$.\n",
      "\n",
      "**(c)**  \n",
      "- It was essential to refer to the assumptions in the relations to comment on their applicability; this point was often lost.  \n",
      "- The examiners were underwhelmed by many students’ inability to recognize that part (a) determined the applicability of part (b), and in many cases, its questionable validity.  \n",
      "- To quantitatively assess the applicability of an assumption, a corresponding dimensionless number is usually needed. This was rarely, if ever, clearly expressed by the students.  \n",
      "- There were also many misconceptions regarding heating on the vehicle, which is an inviscid effect due to compression. Misunderstandings about Mach number, Reynolds number, and drag or friction coefficients were common. The understanding of isentropic flow relations appeared shallow, though part (c) did highlight these limits and awarded marks where appropriate.\n",

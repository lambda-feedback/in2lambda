      "Content: Two reservoirs are connected by a tube of length $L$, illustrated in Figure Q1. The liquid level in Reservoir A is higher than in Reservoir B by $\\Delta h$. A diameter, $D$, must be selected for the tube, to achieve a target volume flow rate of $Q_{target}$. The liquid in the reservoirs is Newtonian, with dynamic viscosity, $\\mu$, and density, $\\rho$, both uniform and constant. Assume steady flow in the tube. Consider a cylindrical frame of reference with $z$-axis aligned with the axis of the tube, as schematically shown in Figure Q1, and origin at the entrance of the tube. In this frame of reference, the velocity is uniform along $\\theta$ and pressure is a function of $z$ only. The effect of body forces on the flow in the tube can be neglected. For parts (a) to (f) assume the tube has a constant diameter, $D_0$, and that the velocity is also uniform along $z$.\n",

      "- (a) The fluid is Newtonian, the density is constant and uniform, therefore the flow is incompressible, and the dynamic viscosity is uniform. Considering the fluid as a continuum, the aforementioned assumptions allow us to model the flow using the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. The formulation in cylindrical coordinates is used as suggested in the text of the question (which asks to use a cylindrical frame of reference).\n",
      "- (b) In general, the velocity is a function of time and space, i.e. $\\vec{u}=\\vec{u}(t, r, \\theta, z)$. Since the flow is steady, the velocity does not depend on time. The velocity is also assumed uniform along $z$ and $\\theta$ (i.e. $\\partial \\vec{u} / \\partial \\theta=0$, $\\partial \\vec{u} / \\partial z=0$), therefore the velocity also does not depend on $\\theta$ and $z$. This means that the velocity must be a function of $r$ only.\n",

As in lubrication problems, the pressure scale is taken as $\\\\mu U_{z}/L$.', '(h) For $\\\\epsilon \\\\ll 1$ (as indicated by the text) and $Re_{L}>1$, there are two leading order terms, and the equation can be approximated as follows:\\n\\n$0=-\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho U_{z}L}\\\\frac{L}{D}\\\\frac{\\\\partial p^{*}}{\\\\partial z^{*}}+\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho U_{z}L}\\\\frac{L}{D}\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{r^{*}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r^{*}}\\\\left(r^{*}\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_{z}^{*}}{\\\\partial r^{*}}\\\\right)\\\\right].$\\n\\nThis equation has the same form of the $z$-component of the momentum balance used for the solution of part (d).

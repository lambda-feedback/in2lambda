      "- (a) The fluid is Newtonian, the density is constant and uniform, therefore the flow is incompressible, and the dynamic viscosity is uniform. Considering the fluid as a continuum, the aforementioned assumptions allow us to model the flow using the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. The formulation in cylindrical coordinates is used as suggested in the text of the question (which asks to use a cylindrical frame of reference).\n",
      "- (b) In general, the velocity is a function of time and space, i.e. $\\vec{u}=\\vec{u}(t, r, \\theta, z)$. Since the flow is steady, the velocity does not depend on time. The velocity is also assumed uniform along $z$ and $\\theta$ (i.e. $\\partial \\vec{u} / \\partial \\theta=0$, $\\partial \\vec{u} / \\partial z=0$), therefore the velocity also does not depend on $\\theta$ and $z$. This means that the velocity must be a function of $r$ only.\n",

As in lubrication problems, the pressure scale is taken as $\\\\mu U_{z}/L$.', '(h) For $\\\\epsilon \\\\ll 1$ (as indicated by the text) and $Re_{L}>1$, there are two leading order terms, and the equation can be approximated as follows:\\n\\n$0=-\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho U_{z}L}\\\\frac{L}{D}\\\\frac{\\\\partial p^{*}}{\\\\partial z^{*}}+\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho U_{z}L}\\\\frac{L}{D}\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{r^{*}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r^{*}}\\\\left(r^{*}\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_{z}^{*}}{\\\\partial r^{*}}\\\\right)\\\\right].$\\n\\nThis equation has the same form of the $z$-component of the momentum balance used for the solution of part (d). Therefore, the solution is the same, i.e.:\\n\\n$u_{z}=-\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\mu}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}p}{\\\\mathrm{d}z}\\\\left(\\\\frac{D(z)^{2}}{4}-r^{2}\\\\right)$.', '(i) A slight increase of diameter would lead to a slightly higher flow rate.

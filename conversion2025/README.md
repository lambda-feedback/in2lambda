# README

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (`file_name.ipynb`) is designed for processing scientific documents, extracting mathematical expressions, and formatting them in Markdown. It leverages Mathpix and OpenAI's LLM capabilities for text transformation.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API keys:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
   OPENAI_MODEL=<your-openai-model>
   MATHPIX_API_KEY=<your-mathpix-key>
   MATHPIX_APP_ID=<your-mathpix-id>
   ```
4. Open `file_name.ipynb` and execute the cells to process your documents.

## Notes
- Ensure your API key and endpoint are correct, as they are required for LLM functionality.
- The notebook is designed for scientific documents, but can be extended to other text formats.

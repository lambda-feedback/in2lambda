assumptions:
    - only 1 set of questions
    - the set of question contains the questions AND solutions
    - parts are only 1 level deep (i.e. no Q1, part a), i)
    - individual questions and solutions are seperatable by using just lines
    - all parts are explicitly enumerated
    - Chunky Independent Maths are deperated (otherwise Mathpix will not be able to seperate them)


parts needs to be ordered
